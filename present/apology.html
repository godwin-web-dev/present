            Hi Charishma,<br><br>
            I know you might be completely mad at me for creating this website for your birthday, but I'm sorry for that.<br><br>
            I typed birthday wishes for you yesterday, 19-12-2025, around 9pm. But it wasn't until I saw your birthday photo on Pavan's mobile that I realized everyone was invited to your birthday party. Pavan had called Deepika as well, but I wasn't invited.<br><br>
            I decided, even if Pavan scolded me, to ask if you wouldn't mind if I came to your birthday party. He said that you didn't want a birthday party at all, because if you invited people, I would also be coming. So, he said that's why you were saying you didn't want a party.<br><br>
            I was completely worried—why should someone stop celebrating because of me?<br><br>
            So, on the next day, your birthday, I visited a temple and prayed to God, asking for forgiveness for being the reason behind this. I only prayed for one thing:<br><br>
            "Wherever she goes, please be with her, show her the right direction, and I wish she achieves everything in her life. Whatever bad things are going to happen to her, let them happen to me, and whatever good things belong to her, let them stay with her."<br><br>
            After visiting the temple, I went to the office. Later that evening, before logging out, I saw Pavan watching your birthday photos. They weren't clearly visible to me, but after a glimpse, I went outside to get some air, then came back and asked Pavan, "Anyhow, I wasn't invited to her birthday party, can I please have a look at her?" Out of shame, I asked. He showed me your picture and your favorite pineapple-flavored cake, with "Cherry Cherry" written on it. I'm glad you celebrated your birthday, and I felt a bit of relief from that guilt.<br><br>
            It's not new to me, not being invited to birthday parties. Ever since my intermediate and BTech days, everyone pretended to be nice to me, but I was never invited to any occasions—neither reunions, birthdays, movies, nor outings. None of that bothered me, this one  left me completely shattered.<br><br>
            I know you might be angry with me, but please forgive me for being the reason behind this. I never wanted to be a burden in your life. I just want you to be happy, always.<br><br>
            I wish you many more happy returns of the day, Charishma.<br><br>
